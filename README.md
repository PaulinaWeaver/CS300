# CS300 ABCU Academic Advising Tool

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

The problem I was solving in the projects for this course revolved around developing a program to assist academic advisors in the Computer Science department at ABCU. The program aimed to organize and display information about Computer Science courses, including printing a list of courses in alphanumeric order and providing details about individual courses, such as their titles and prerequisites.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

In approaching this problem, I first identified the key requirements and functionalities needed for the program, such as loading course data from a file, sorting and organizing the data, and providing user interaction through a menu system. I then designed pseudocode for different data structures (vector, hash table, and binary search tree) to determine the most suitable structure for storing and manipulating the course information efficiently. Understanding data structures was crucial in this process because it allowed me to choose the appropriate structure based on factors like search and insertion efficiency, memory usage, and ease of implementation.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

To overcome any roadblocks encountered during the project, I relied on a systematic approach of breaking down the problem into smaller, manageable tasks. I also utilized resources such as documentationa and online tutorials to gain insights and troubleshoot issues. Additionally, I iteratively tested and refined my code to ensure its correctness and efficiency before proceeding to the next steps.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Working on this project expanded my approach to designing software and developing programs by emphasizing the importance of planning and designing before implementation. I learned the significance of choosing the right data structures and algorithms to optimize program performance and efficiency. Additionally, I gained experience in analyzing requirements, designing pseudocode, and evaluating trade-offs between different design choices.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Through this project, I have improved my skills in writing programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable. By following best practices in pseudocode design and documentation, I ensured that my code is understandable and easy to maintain for myself and other developers. Moreover, I learned to write modular and reusable code, which enhances adaptability and scalability, allowing for easier modifications and extensions in the future. Overall, this project has reinforced the importance of writing clean, well-organized code that is both functional and flexible.
